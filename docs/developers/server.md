# :material-server: Server

## Overview

Hot Tub enables you to host your own video content. It is a self-contained application that can be deployed on a server or a local machine.

We've published a typescript package on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hottubapp/api-core) for your convenience, containing types, models, and utils to help you get started.
