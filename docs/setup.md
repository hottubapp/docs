So you've got the app installed, and you're ready to start using it.

## Onboarding

When you first launch the app, you'll be greeted with a welcome screen sporting some fancy animations and general info about the app.

As of version 2.1.2, the app no longer automatically adds a source for you. You'll need to add a source manually.

To do this, tap the "‚öôÔ∏è" button in the top left corner of the screen. This will open the settings menu. Navigate to the "Sources" section and enter the URL of the source you want to add.

You'll be presented with a list of sources to choose from. For now, we'll just add the example source. Tap the "Add" button to add the source.

!!! info "Adding the Hot Tub Source"

      If you are 18 years or older, you can add the Hot Tub source to browse adult content.
