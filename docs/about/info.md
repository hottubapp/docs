## What is Hot Tub?

Hot Tub is the first Apple-notarized adult-video streaming app native to iOS. We set out to build the best viewing experience there is. When it comes to consuming content, Hot Tub is a breath of fresh air: free of intrusive ads, annoying pop-ups, redirect rabbit-holes, and sketchy data-brokers harvesting your data. With no account account needed, you can watch in private, securely save your favorite videos, frequent searches, and watch history, all saved locally on your device.

## Why Hot Tub?

We designed Hot Tub to put you in the driver seat— or rather, next to the jets— empowering you to fully customize your experience. Looking for a more private experience? You can disable (or even just hide) favorites and/or watch history. We put privacy & security at the forefront when designing the app. Open Hot Tub and you'll see privacy screen, with options to require FaceID / TouchID / passcode to unlock the app.

Hot Tub is also extensible, utilizing a concept of _"sources"_. A _source_ is a dedicated server from which the app can retrieve videos from. We've published our API (application programming interface) specifications, along with developer packages and documentation, so anyone can create a source which can be added to Hot Tub. Each source can contain multiple _"channels"_. A _channel_ is a dedicated group where videos are loaded from.
