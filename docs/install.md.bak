## Installing Hot Tub

So you're ready to take a dip and get in the Hot Tub... Now what?

Hot Tub isn't available on Apple's 1st party App Store. Instead, you'll need to install it through either a 3rd party app store / marketplace, or [manually install the .ipa](https://hottubapp.io/download) file on your device.

### ðŸ“± Alternative App Marketplaces

If youâ€™re based in the European Union, you can install apps from sources other than the App Store on your iPhone with iOS 17.4 or later, or your iPad with iPadOS 18 or later. [Learn More](https://support.apple.com/en-us/117767?cid=ot-ols-apps-article_117767-installation_message-02022024)

### ðŸª„ Signing Services

Signing services offer a convenient method to install apps on your device without needing a computer. These services manage the signing of apps using enterprise certificates, enabling direct installation on your device. This process typically involves purchasing a signing certificate or subscription from the service provider.
