## Installing Hot Tub

So you're ready to take a dip with Hot Tub: Now what?

Hot Tub isn't available on Apple's 1st party App Store. Instead, you'll need to install it through either a 3rd party app store / marketplace, or [manually install the .ipa](https://hottubapp.io/download) file on your device.
