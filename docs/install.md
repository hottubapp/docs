## Install Hot Tub

So you're ready to take a dip and get in the Hot Tub... Now what?

Hot Tub isn't available on Apple's 1st party App Store, since they do not allow adult content apps. Instead, you'll need to install it through either a 3rd party app store / marketplace, or manually install the .ipa file on your device.

### AltStore PAL

If you're located within the European Union (EU), we recommend using [AltStore PAL](https://faq.altstore.io/altstore-pal/what-is-altstore-pal). AltStore PAL is an official alternative app marketplace available only in the EU. With AltStore PAL you can install apps not available in the App Store, but without the limitations of AltStore (World).

After installing AltStore PAL, you can install Hot Tub by [adding the source](https://hottubapp.io/altstore/pal) to AltStore PAL.

### AltStore World

If you're not located within the EU, you can still install Hot Tub with a process known as "side-loading". Side loading refers to the process of using a computer to install apps on your device. The AltStore team have assembled some excellent resources to help get you started with guides for both [Windows](https://faq.altstore.io/altstore-classic/how-to-install-altstore-windows) & [macOS](https://faq.altstore.io/altstore-classic/how-to-install-altstore-macos). You can download the latest release of Hot Tub from our [downloads](https://hottubapp.io/download) page.

After installing AltStore, you can install Hot Tub by [adding the source](https://hottubapp.io/altstore) to AltStore.
